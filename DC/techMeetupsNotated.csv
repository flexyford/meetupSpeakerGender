In this talk Joseph Rickert, blogger, data scientist and R community Ambassador introduces the latest R technology to scale your data analysis.</p> <p>-- TALK OUTLINE --  </p> <p>Microsoft R Server (formerly Revolution R Enterprise) has become the foundation for Microsoft’s use or the R language to tackle big-data machine learning and predictive analytics tasks. At the heart of MRS is the RevoScaleR package that implements a number of parallel external memory algorithms. These “PEMAs” are inherently parallel and designed for distributed computing on large data sets. Unlike standard open source R functions they do not require all of the data to be in memory at one time. I will provide an overview of MRS and show some examples of PEMAs working on data sets too large to be processed by open source R algorithms on my laptop.</p> <p>-- SPEAKER --</p> <p>Joseph Rickert is a Program Manager and R Community Ambassador for Microsoft. He came to Microsoft with the rest of Revolution Analytics team where he worked as a data scientist, blog editor and special programs manager.  He is currently Microsoft’s representative to the R Consortium’s Infrastructure Steering Committee and a member of the organizing committee for useR!2016. </p> <p>Previously, Joe held a variety of technical and marketing roles while working for technology startups that spanned multiple industries from local area networks to disk drives, test equipment and health care.

"54",1,1,0,0,"<p>For our first Data Science DC Meetup of 2016, we will be delving into how to scale up unsupervised learning -- the process of finding structure and groups in unlabeled data. Typical off-the-shelf clustering algorithms require painful operations such as computing a distance measure of all pairs of items. Shrayes Ramesh, data scientist at L-3 Data Tactics, will walk through the challenges and lessons he's learned when trying to cluster large-scale data distributed across many machines. </p> <p><br/><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>• 6:30pm -- Networking, Empanadas, and Refreshments</p> <p>• 7:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements</p> <p>• 7:15pm -- Presentations and Discussion</p> <p>• 8:30pm -- Data Drinks (Tonic, 2036 G Street NW)</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>Unsupervised clustering is a useful approach to partitioning massive datasets into meaningful subpopulations. However, as data sets get larger, many traditional algorithms have difficultly scaling.  Here, I motivate the use of ensemble clustering as a scalable, robust approach to clustering at large, distributed datasets. The three components of ensemble clustering: (1) generating first-stage clusters, (2) aligning clustering output, and (3) aggregation and voting will be explained in a walkthrough demonstration and their nuances discussed. Finally, I will show some examples of clustering output and talk about extensions that can be made to the ensemble clustering framework that lend itself nicely to other modern unsupervised learning techniques.</p> <p><b>Bio:</b></p> <p>Shrayes Ramesh is a Senior Data Scientist at L-3. He has spent the past two years on a cybersecurity research program, where he researches, builds and implements unsupervised learning and outlier detection models at scale. Previously, he has worked teaching and evangelizing data science and big data methodologies for EMC as part of their education and training department. In a prior life, he has completed doctorate studies in Economics at the University of Maryland and undergraduate studies in Economics and Cognitive Science at University of Virginia.

Your tests are too… but they shouldn't be!</p> <p>Years helping teams write better tests has taught me one thing: consistency is crucial. Inconsistent tests slow teams down, wasting time to understand how each test works. Deciding on conventions—even arbitrary ones—can prevent tremendous pain later.</p> <p>This talk will introduce a ready-to-fork Test Style Guide of carefully-considered rules and templates for Rubyists. You can customize it to fit your preferred tools, too. Soon, you'll be on your way to having more consistent tests that are much more fun to maintain!</p> <p>---</p> <p>Everything You Know About the GIL is Wrong<br/>When a Rubyist hears ""concurrency"" they usually Google Elixir, Go, or even Node.js. Turns out, Ruby can be great for concurrency! The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) does NOT prevent Ruby programs from performing concurrently. In this presentation we'll discuss the true meaning of concurrency, explore the inner-workings of the GIL, and gain a deeper understanding of how the GIL effects concurrent programs. Along the way we'll write a bunch of concurrent Ruby code, run it on multiple interpreters, and compare the results.</p> <p>----</p> <p>A Tale of Two Feature Flags<br/>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Feature flags are a quick win for development teams seeking a way to more rapidly release software but can create unexpected technical complexity.</p> <p>Join us for a comparison of the life-cycles of two seemingly similar feature flags.

But helping humans visualize real-time streams is just as important. Visualizing real-time data introduces new UX and usability challenges for any developer embedding analytics into applications, especially when the target end users are business users and not data scientists. Self-service, interactive, subsecond response time to ad hoc queries -- these are the new UX requirements for any enterprise visualizing real-time data. Streaming data also lends itself to new paradigms of interaction with the stream itself, like being able to pause, rewind and replay a stream. This talk is a case study in how and why Zoomdata built a ""Data DVR"" capability using Spark and SparkStreaming. Ruhollah Farchtchi, Chief Technologist &amp; VP of <a href=""http://www.zoomdata.com/"">Zoomdata</a> Labs will describe the required user experience, the overall architecture and the specific use of Spark and Spark Streaming. We will describe the design considerations that led us to choose Spark Streaming over alternatives like Storm. We will show how end users configure the real-time increment and a historical retention window without writing any code themselves. We will also show how pause, rewind, replay is implemented inSpark and how the solution supports both real-time and historical analysis in the same architecture. Attendees will walk away with knowledge of Spark Streaming and how users can interactively work with streaming data. They will develop familiarity with the challenges of a lambda architecture and providing a consistent analytic experience over streaming and historical data.""</p> <p><b> Leveraging Spark in a Hybrid OLTP/OLAP RDBMS</b></p> <p>In this talk, we will discuss how we use Spark as part of a hybrid RDBMS architecture that includes Hadoop and HBase. The optimizer evaluates each query and sends OLTP traffic (including CRUD queries) to HBase and OLAP traffic to Spark. We will focus on the challenges of handling the tradeoffs inherent in an integrated architecture that simultaneously handles real-time and batch traffic. Lessons learned include: - Embedding Spark into a RDBMS - Running Spark on Yarn and isolating OLTP traffic from OLAP traffic - Accelerating the generation of Spark RDDs from HBase - Customizing the Spark UI The lessons learned can also be applied to other hybrid systems, such as Lambda architectures.</p> <p><b>John Leach </b>is the CTO and Co-Founder of <a href=""http://www.splicemachine.com/"">Splice Machine</a>.

"85",1,1,0,0,"<p>Please join us for an exciting talk by Dr. Alexandr ""Sasha"" Draganov about the mathematics behind prediction and mitigation of rare, catastrophic events. </p> <p><b>About the Talk</b></p> <p>How do we quantify risk that is associated with a financial instrument? Intuitively, risk is clearly connected to the probability of a loss.  In a simple case, we estimate the volatility; however, the dreadful experience of the recent financial crisis shows that volatility alone does not paint the full picture.  The common computation of volatility misses the possibility of rare but catastrophic events.  </p> <p><br/>One possible reason for this limitation is the overuse of the so-called normal probability distribution.  It is called ""normal"" for a reason: indeed, it is the most common way to characterize random variations (such as variations in the value of securities).  However, this tool must not be applied indiscriminately.  A deeper dive shows that it often fails for large, rare variations, precisely when there is a possibility of a failure.  </p> <p>This concept was popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who christened such events Black Swans.  Popular books notwithstanding, there is a real mathematical foundation today to deal with this problem.  Applications are common in the insurance industry (Hurricane Katrina) or for construction in the regions, where earthquakes are common. </p> <p>We have recently completed a DARPA-funded research program, where we applied these new ideas for engineering applications.  Using real data from various sensors, we were able to detect and mitigate outliers in real time.  In this presentation, we will review the concept and the science of rare, catastrophic events, and will talk about ways to alleviate their effects.</p> <p><b>Meetup Agenda</b></p> <p><br/>6:30 PM - Networking, Food &amp; Drink</p> <p>7:00 PM - Intro &amp; Talk</p> <p>Join us for more discussion after the event with Data Drinks (location TBD).</p> <p><b>Sponsors for this Event</b></p> <p>Thanks to <a href=""http://www.datacommunitydc.org/"">Data Community DC</a> for organizational support, to <a href=""https://www.contactually.com/"">Contactually</a> for space, and to <a href=""https://www.excella.com/careers"">Excella Consulting</a> for our food and drink.</p> <p><b>About Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Alexandr “Sasha” Draganov grew up in the Soviet Union, with a limited access to computers. When you cannot rely on a computer, you have to compensate by honing your math and analytical techniques. Today, Sasha uses these skills to do research and development in multiple fields, including applied mathematics, algorithm development, signal processing, and telecommunications. He authored winning proposals and served as the Principal Investigator for multimillion-dollar research and development programs. Sasha published over 40 papers, and presented at dozens of conferences. He holds five U.S. patents. He has a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford and a Masters in Theoretical Physics from Kiev University, Ukraine.</p> <p>Sasha runs two start-up companies: one is performing contract research and development for government and commercial customers, and another is developing an innovative software application for personal finance.</p> <p>Sasha loves books. He got hooked on reading while serving 2 years in the Soviet military in a small town, where a local library was the only source of entertainment.

Many market-leading companies like Lenovo have recognized that knowing the high-level web and mobile statistics about their visitors is valuable but not actionable. The key to understanding the needs of customers and visitors and delivering personalized experiences is predictive behavioral analytics, which requires integrating clickstream and other enterprise data on a Hadoop/Spark cluster. The clickstream data as generated by the leading marketing cloud providers like Adobe, Google, and IBM are also varied and complex with over a 1000 configurable fields. However, the clickstream data has enough commonality across enterprises that deploying a configurable purpose-built predictive behavioral application like SYNTASA can deliver significantly better time-to-value and ROI compared to an in-house development effort. In this session we will describe 1) Lenovo’s build vs. buy decision and 2) What makes Spark the ideal platform for building an predictive behavioral analytics application like SYNTASA that can be deployed on in-house Hadoop Cluster.</p> <p><b>Agenda: </b>

In this talk, we engage non-expert transcribers who are given minimal instructions to bootstrap an automatic speech recognition system. With transcription costs of only five dollars per hour of data, the transcribers have an error rate of 25%.

"115",1,2,0,0,"<p>Join us on <b>Wednesday, May 25th, 2016</b> as we discuss Emerging Technology Solutions with Graphistry, Inc. We will also discuss scanning and enumeration tools and techniques. For those who would like to have additional hands-on time, we will have a mobile lab in place for you to practice techniques you are already familiar with.</p> <p>To protect all our connected devices and software, security teams must now “assume breach,” putting resources into response and recovery. This has required organizations to rethink their end-to-end data pipelines. The SIEM side has been successful in aggregating alerts from across vendors, but the visual analytics tier still largely derives from the dashboard tools of 30 years ago. Visual tools have not kept pace with the increase in data, so we have lost situational awareness.</p> <p>Graphistry has been scaling visual analytics by using GPU clusters. We will demonstrate previously impossible ways of understanding and exploring millions of security alerts. For example, we will show how Graphistry’s scaled-up network diagrams helped quickly understand and navigate hundreds of millions daily alerts. In another example, as an individual alert is a symptom of a greater attack, we will show how this enables us to quickly pivot and expand the context to diagnose what else happened before and after an alert, and thereby guide subsequent remediations. Finally, as part of security’s shift into the data era, we will showcase how Graphistry uses Jupyter/IPython Notebooks with Python and Spark to create shareable forensic analyses that combine code and interactive visualizations.</p> <p><b>Keynote Speakers:</b><br/>Leo Meyerovich &amp; Thibaud Hottelier, Graphistry, Inc</p> <p><b>Linkedin:</b><br/><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-meyerovich-09649219"" class=""linkified"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-meyerovich-09649219</a><br/><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thibaudhottelier"" class=""linkified"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/thibaudhottelier</a></p> <p><br/><b>Twitter:</b><br/>@graphistry<br/>@lmeyerov</p> <p><b>Meetup Location: </b><br/>RiverHouse Party Room<br/>1111 Army Navy Dr.<br/>Arlington, VA 22202<br/>Google Map: <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/K1gkrZVXwCB2"" class=""linkified"">https://goo.gl/maps/K1gkrZVXwCB2</a></p> <p>This meetup will be held on the Basement level, personnel will be onsite to assist.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b><br/>6:00 - 6:15 Networking<br/>6:15 - 7:00 Presentation 1<br/>7:00 - 7:15 Networking<br/>7:15 - 8:00 Presentation 2<br/>8:00 - 8:30 Closing remarks, networking &amp; clean up</p> <p><b>Parking (Denison Parking):</b> Free parking is available at 850 Army Navy Dr., Arlington, VA 22202.<br/>Google Map: <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/bHAK4oU1tMu"" class=""linkified"">https://goo.gl/maps/bHAK4oU1tMu</a></p> <p><b>Meetup Sponsorship: </b>With nearly 3,000 members, our group is full of Information Security professionals enthusiastic about staying abreast to new trends and changes in the industry.

From affecting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat_and_cardiovascular_disease_controversy#Systematic_reviews"">what we choose to eat</a> to looking at <a href=""https://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science-news/new-meta-analysis-confirms-no-association-between-vaccines-and-autism"">vaccines' impact on autism</a>, meta-analyses have an impact in improving our knowledge and understanding, specially when a topic is confusing or has contradictory results and views. It is a means of seeing the forest for the trees, distilling and synthesizing the extant knowledge about a topic.</p> <p>Meta-analyses are mainly seen in the world of biomedical research, so interest is in ""treatments"", namely drugs  or particular diets or the like. However, ""treatments"" can mean a marketing campaign or a behavioral intervention (like spanking) or a change of a protocol. With that understanding, meta-analysis refers to the synthesis of results from several small but comparable studies to derive overall estimates of treatment effects that typically will be more robust and have higher statistical power. </p> <p>Classical meta-analysis involves studies looking at the same treatments to get an overall summary effect of one particular treatment effect. Network meta-analysis can be modeled to utilize indirect comparisons to compare the relative effectiveness of several different treatments of the same condition. In this presentation I will describe both classical and network meta-analysis, as well as the typical problems and biases one has to be aware of in doing meta-analyses. The computations and weighting schemes used in meta-analysis can have direct applications to implement a Divide-and-Conquer strategy so that modeling of large data sets can be done in chunks and the results combined to get valid results for the entire data set. I will describe an example from my experience in fitting competing risks models to a large administrative data set.</p> <p><b>Bio:</b></p> <p><br/><b>Abhijit Dasgupta</b></p> <p>Dr. Abhijit Dasgupta is a consulting statistician/data scientist in the Washington DC metropolis. He is fascinated by the innovative use of data analytic methods to gain insight and tell substantive stories, using modern methods for modeling, simulation and visualization.</p> <p>A PhD-level biostatistician by training, Dr. Dasgupta currently works to bridge the statistics-machine learning divide, by merging machine learning methods with sound statistical thinking and principles to help enhance our ability to derive intelligence from data. He now has over 50 peer-reviewed research and collaborative papers in areas ranging from bioinformatics, cancer research and operations research to methods for cluster analysis and intelligent robust modeling. He also consults for local startups doing bioengineering, business analytics and bioinformatics.

The similarities between learned representations of Congresses over time and sitting Presidents are negatively correlated with the bill veto rate, and the temporal ordering of Presidents and Congresses was implicitly learned from only text.</p> <p>Second, we describe <a href=""http://predictgov.com/"">PredictGov</a>, a machine learning system for predicting Congress. Starting with the 107th Congress, we trained models on data from previous Congresses, predicted all bills in the current Congress, and repeated until the 113th Congress served as the test. The median of the predicted probabilities for enacted bills was 0.71, while the median of the predicted probabilities for failed bills was 0.01.

Both Accumulo and Spark can be used on Hadoop file system (HDFS). Both technologies together become a great way to do ETL first, and follow up with analytics using Sparks MLlib or GraphX.</p> <p>The goal of this presentation is to add new tools to the the data scientist toolbox.

First, anomaly detection techniques are surveyed at a high level so that their shortcomings are exposed. The shortcomings are mainly their inflexibility in the use of a context ‘window’ size and/or their suboptimal performance in handling sequences. Furthermore, high-performing techniques for sequences are usually associated with their respective knowledge domains. After discussing these shortcomings, RNNs are exposed mathematically as generic sequence modelers that can handle sequences of arbitrary length. From there, results from experiments using RNNs show their ability to detect anomalies in a set of test sequences. The test sequences had different types of anomalies and unique normal behavior. Given the characteristics of the test data, it was concluded that the RNNs were not only able to generically distinguish rare values in the data (out of context) but were also able to generically distinguish abnormal patterns (in context).</p> <p> In addition to the anomaly detection work, a solution for reproducing computational research is described. The solution addresses reproducing compute applications based on Docker container technology as well as automating the infrastructure that runs the applications. By design, the solution allows the researcher to seamlessly transition from local (test) application execution to remote (production) execution because little distinction is made between local and remote execution. Such flexibility and automation allows the researcher to be more confident of results and more productive, especially when dealing with multiple machines. </p> <p><b>Bio:</b></p> <p><br/><b><a href=""https://about.me/majidaldosari"">Majid Al-Dosari</a></b></p> <p><br/>Majid recently completed his (second) Master's degree in Computational Science from George Mason University.

Please come out to hear some exciting Spark talks from Capital One and SnappyData. </p> <p><b>TALK 1</b></p> <p><b>Title</b>: Deep dive into analysis of scalable DB Solution for Data Analytics Platform. </p> <p><b>Abstract</b>: To implement a scalable database solution for our analytics needs CapitalOne team has done analysis on Cassandra and HBase that helped us in making right choice for the usecase. We would like to present our analysis and the challenges we faced and experiences we incurred to the audience.

<b>TALK 2</b></p> <p><b>Title: </b>Explore big data at speed of thought with Spark 2.0 and SnappyData</p> <p><b>Abstract: </b><br/>Data exploration often requires running aggregation/slice-dice queries on data sourced from disparate sources. You may want to identify distribution patterns, outliers, etc and aid the feature selection process as you train your predictive models. As you begin to understand your data, you want to ask ad-hoc questions expressed through your visualization tool (which typically translates to SQL queries), study the results and iteratively explore the data set through more queries. Unfortunately, even when data sets can be in-memory, large data set computations take time breaking the train of thought and increasing time to insight . We know Spark can be fast through its in-memory parallel processing. But, Spark 1.x isn’t quite there. Spark 2.0 promises to offer 10X better speed than its predecessor. Spark 2.0 ushers some impressive improvements to interactive query performance. We first explore these advances - compiling the query plan eliminating virtual function calls, and other improvements in the Catalyst engine. We compare the performance to other popular popular query processing engines by studying the spark query plans. We then go through SnappyData (an open source project that integrates Spark with a database that offers OLTP, OLAP and stream processing in a single cluster) where we use smarter data colocation and Synopses data (.e.g. Stratified sampling) to dramatically cut down on the memory requirements as well as the query latency. We explain the key concepts in summarizing data using structures like stratified sampling by walking through some examples in Apache Zeppelin notebooks (a open source visualization tool for spark) and demonstrate how we can explore massive data sets with just your laptop resources while achieving remarkable speeds. </p> <p>

You’ll also learn about the analytical processes and data systems available to build and empower data products that can handle—and actually require—huge amounts of data.</p> <p>• Understand core concepts behind Hadoop and cluster computing</p> <p>• Use design patterns and parallel analytical algorithms to create distributed data analysis jobs</p> <p>• Learn about data management, mining, and warehousing in a distributed context using Apache Hive and HBase</p> <p>• Use Sqoop and Apache Flume to ingest data from relational databases</p> <p>• Program complex Hadoop and Spark applications with Apache Pig and Spark DataFrames</p> <p>• Perform machine learning techniques such as classification, clustering, and collaborative filtering with Spark’s MLlib</p> <p><br/>About the Authors</p> <p>Benjamin Bengfort is a Data Scientist who lives inside the beltway but ignores politics (the normal business of DC) favoring technology instead. He is currently working to finish his PhD at the University of Maryland where he studies machine learning and distributed computing. His lab does have robots (though this field of study is not one he favors) and, much to his chagrin, they seem to constantly arm said robots with knives and tools; presumably to pursue culinary accolades. Having seen a robot attempt to slice a tomato, Benjamin prefers his own adventures in the kitchen where he specializes in fusion French and Guyanese cuisine as well as BBQ of all types. A professional programmer by trade, a Data Scientist by vocation, Benjamin's writing pursues a diverse range of subjects from Natural Language Processing, to Data Science with Python to analytics with Hadoop and Spark.</p> <p>Jenny Kim is an experienced big data engineer who works in both commercial software efforts as well as in academia. She has significant experience in working with large scale data, machine learning, and Hadoop implementations in production and research environments. Jenny (with Benjamin Bengfort) previously built a large scale recommender system that used a web crawler to gather ontological information about apparel products and produce recommendations from transactions.

While working for the BBC his work included coverage, both short and long-form, of international politics, five U.S. Presidential elections, battlefield conflict, diplomacy, the United Nations and its agencies, as well as natural and human tragedies.</p> <p>In the 90s Mark made the intrepid voyage across the Atlantic via jet airplane to hold senior management positions with the BBC’s New York Bureau before transferring to US Public Radio, serving senior positions at WNYC in New York, where he built a stellar reporting team that won the Edward R. Murrow Award and the DuPont Columbia Award for investigative reporting.  After Mark left New York he became Programming Director WAMU in Washington, DC, in this position he brought podcasting, internet streaming, and digital content management to WAMU, expanding the station’s range and increasing the listing base dramatically.</p> <p>Mark is the founder and CEO of Birkdale Media, a boutique media and public relations firm; Birkdale specializes in media coaching, interview preparation, public relations for individuals and for corporations.</p> <p>Above all else, Mark is a champion for data and data visualization in the newsroom and on the air.  We conducted an interview with him and were really impressed by the passion he displayed for Data Viz – full text of the interview below:</p> <p><br/>1) What got you into data visualization and how do you think data visualization has enhanced your profession? </p> <p><b>Mark: </b>TV and Video Graphics have become so much more sophisticated in the digital age that they can be designed much more quickly, easily, and contain much more useful information for viewers, helping producers to explain complex stories and issues, and put them into better context than ever before. The internet means blogs, news-sites, etc. can contain way more vital information and background than they did before - and many organizations are utilizing data to enhance their story-telling, provide background, history, and further detail. </p> <p>


2) You worked for the BBC, how do you think that working for an international news agency affected your views on data? </p> <p><b>Mark: </b>In my day (80's and 90's) a sophisticated graphic could take days, even weeks to assemble to be inserted into a news report. New technology speeds this process meaning producers can make much better use of graphics on video and on the web. </p> <p>


3) How do you see data visualization shaping the future of news media or vice versa how do you see news media shaping the path of data visualization? </p> <p><b>Mark: </b>It opens up vast new possibilities for journalism. Better analysis, better explanations and details in investigative work (being able to collate and display complex documents, and show how they relate to each other, for instance). The news media in turn can drive the quest for big data using the Freedom of Information legislation on complex stories and issues and making it public utilizing graphics and big data. </p> <p>


4) How do we make the news - print, media, digital, etc.- Great Again? </p> <p><b>Mark: </b>By using our imagination about how to tell stories and raise important issues in a more captivating and compelling way, rather than feeding the public cheap consumer-driven news which is often second or third hand. </p> <p>


5) What international news story from the past decade could have had a different outcome if data visualization was better used in covering it? </p> <p><b>Mark: </b>Resolution from any conflict zone you care to mention - by using big data to report it more accurately (Iraq, for example) thus raising public awareness. </p> <p><br/><b>Sponsor Announcements: </b></p> <p><img src=""http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/2/4/600_453868196.jpeg"" /></p> <p><img src=""http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/6/0/0/600_452550208.jpeg"" /></p> <p><img src=""http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/5/f/e/600_452550206.jpeg"" /></p>","Data Visualization DC","Success & Sanity in Data Journalism",1475015400000

"166",1,1,0,0,"<p>How to build a recommendation engine, for wine.</p> <p>===== TALK OUTLINE =====</p> <p>Wine pairing has long been an art and a science, dependent upon an elite palate and firm grasp of experience. But it doesn't have to be that way. In this talk, Joseph Nelson discusses how data science enables individuals, even those with little subject area expertise, to produce functioning recommendation engines. Upon an award from the French Embassy, he led a team that sought to use data science to build a functioning wine recommendation engine. He describes clustering, user segmentation, and modeling to provide accurate pairings. While the model is not currently in deployment, Joseph discusses how French culinary experts reacted to an unveiling of the demonstration.</p> <p> ====== SPEAKER ======</p> <p><br/>Joseph is currently an instructor for General Assembly’s Data Science Immersive in DC. He particularly enjoys model selection and validation techniques as well as natural language processing. He has also guest lectured as a part of the Master’s in Data Science program at George Washington University. Previously, he built data visualization dashboards and data pipelines as a part of Facebook’s Politics and Government team. Joseph is an advocate for using technology to improve social well-being, particularly in government. When he’s not modeling (data), he’s reading, running, or learning the tools to build his next side project.</p> <p>You can find him on Twitter: <a href=""https://twitter.com/josephofiowa"" class=""linkified"">https://twitter.com/josephofiowa</a> and Github: github.com/josephofiowa</p> <p>-- TENTATIVE SCHEDULE --</p> <p>6:30-7:00 - Networking<br/>7:00-7:10 - Introductions<br/>7:10 - 8:10 - Talk<br/>&gt; 8:10- Socializing</p>","Data Education DC","Building a Wine Recommendation Engine (When You Don't Know Wine)",1477607400000

"168",1,4,0,0,"<p>Join us on <b>Wednesday, October 12th, 2016</b> as we discuss <b>An Intro to Machine Learning for Cybersecurity and Threat Hunting and Information Security Policies</b>.</p> <p>The use of machine learning is one of the most important new trends in cybersecurity. In this session we’ll walk through an overview of machine learning and the creation of a simple machine learning script in Python that you can learn to find malicious activity in your HTTP proxy logs. At the end of it all, you'll not only gain a useful tool to help you identify things that your IDS and SIEM might have missed, but you’ll also have the knowledge necessary to adapt that code to other uses as well. We will also provide a short demonstration of how Sqrrl’s threat hunting platform uses advanced machine learning to identify kill chain behaviors and adversary TTPs. Presenters will include David J. Bianco (Sqrrl Security Technologist), Chris McCubbin (Sqrrl Director of Data Science), and Ely Kahn (Sqrrl VP Marketing and Business Development).</p> <p>The Information Security Policy session is for professionals who want to learn more about information security policies and the effect that it has on organizational decision-making. Additionally, the session will provide an overview of the most common policies and laws as well as career paths based on enforcing these regulations. The Information Security Policy is the “Cornerstone of an Information Security Program” and lies at the intersection of business and technology needs.</p> <p><b>Keynote Speaker(s):</b><br/><b>David J.
