As software developers, we go to great lengths to ensure that users can have a seamless experience. However, allowing users to conveniently access their application allows attackers the opportunity to attack users with just as much ease. The eternal struggle that designers and developers face is striking a balance in design and security in order to not compromise the user but optimize his/her satisfaction. This talk will explore some practical strategies that can be implemented in order to improve the security posture of most applications without compromising on the user experience.</p> <p>

<b>Speaker bio:</b> David Vo is a senior consultant with nVisium’s Application Consulting practice. His specialties include application pen-test, source code reviews, and vulnerability analysis, including using fuzzing to find software vulnerabilities.

,,,,"<p>This month's WordPress Practitioner's Meetup is the first in a series of ""The Business of WordPress"" topics our member's have requested. Our WP Practitioners attendees are about evenly divided between business owners and mangers who use WordPress daily in their businesses, and WordPress Freelancers, Developers and Implementors who are building and maintaining WordPress sites for businesses. When I read your topic requests, I approached small business specialist, Sarah Flaherty about presenting to our group. </p> <p>Sarah's tag line is, “Let me think outside the box for you,” illustrates her love for helping emerging businesses and her creativity. In today’s world, there is no unique business, there is only uniqueness. Finding your unique voice is the first and foremost need of a successful business or Freelancer. </p> <p>Your firm’s voice is the single­most important business fundamental, and it is often ignored in our WordPress Community of Developers and Designers. Consumers no longer shop locally, they shop globally ­ on their terms. This makes competition to get their attention, and keep it, fierce. You must be in constant communication with your clients in order to maintain sales and growth. However, you can’t achieve this through a great logo and a fabulous website. You must engage directly with your clients, and this requires you to have a curated voice; consumers flock to you and become your loyal evangelists when they hear and experience your care of them consistently ­ when they know your firm's personality, what and why it's passionate about, and what they can always count on. </p> <p><br/>Sarah C. Flaherty of LUV, LLC will briefly discuss the need to find your voice, how to shape it, and what to do with it once you’ve found it ­ with a focus on social media. This presentation will be followed by a group project that allows you to take a company from conception to initial client communication and will show you the importance of aligning your company’s mission statement with your visuals and content. This will help you better understand your need to content curate to find your firm's unique voice and how to use it going forward.</p> <p>With Sarah’s help, you’ll find that not only will you better understand the hows and whys of what you want to do, but you’ll be better able to focus potential clients’ attention on your business, and keep it.</p> <p><br/>We look forward to seeing you there. Bring your questions and your laptop. The seating at Build-a-Sign can difficult if you are very tall or have a tricky back, so when in doubt, bring a camp chair for your comfort. </p>",The Austin WordPress Meetup Group,Finding Your Company’s Voice,1458691200000

Once mastered, PJ was able and determined to help other businesses that were not adequately served.</p> <p>During this course you will install NginX and configure ssh.

Don't understand the difference between a VM and a container? Why are immutable operating systems cool? Why is everyone going crazy over Kubernetes/Swarm/Apache Mesos? </p> <p>This talk will attempt to inform by pulling back the curtain on the container hype. We will dissect what a container is, why clustering containers and orchestration matters, immutable operating systems and finally where this is all going and how it will effect your future interaction with the cloud. </p> <p>Derrick Wippler is: Tech Geek, Container evangelist, Software Developer, Entrepreneur and Rackspace Cloud Block Storage Imagineer.

But the best way to reduce user-friction is to never require a person to authenticate. This talk will provide a modern solution to reconcile these two divergent imperatives by leveraging standard profiles of OAuth2 for trust elevation.

With a wide variety of needs in the modern business world, Dan Frey and eStaff LLC offers several different methods to fill the empty positions of tech comapnies while helping programmers skip the resume process and get straight to the interview!</p> <p>Their four methods are:</p> <p>• Direct Placement - For this program, they find candidates who can join  tech companies immediately. Typically, the tech client is responsible for paying eStaff LLC so unlike other staffing agencies they do not then take from the new hire's  salary! This option is perfect for companies looking to fill a long-term position immediately and thus skip the resume process.</p> <p>• Contract to Hire - This program is for the employers who want to test out candidates before hiring them. This lets you try out a potential candidate for a period of time to see if they fit well with your company. Payment for this plan is usually in the form of a bill rate of 1.4 times the hourly pay of the candidate. Contract terms are usually three or six months in length, depending on the type of position offered.</p> <p>• Contract - This allows you to bring in personnel for a specific period of time. This is particularly helpful for short-term projects or initiatives where a certain expertise is needed. Maybe you just need some extra help. This is perfect for you. Payment for this plan is usually 1.4 times the hourly rate of the personnel brought in to augment the staff. These candidates may be hired directly following the completion of the contract.</p> <p>• Payrolling - Do you have a potential hire that could use some experience before being brought on staff? This option is for you. Have them temporarily join the eStaff LLC team. Find out what kind of worker they are. Our staffing agency will communicate with you and help you to decide whether to hire the employee. This option is a low risk, high reward type of scenario.</p> <p>Whether you’re looking to hire immediately or take time to evaluate some candidates, the strategic staffing agency here will help you to fill your employment needs nationwide including Austin and the surrounding areas. Do you need more information on one of the opportunities mentioned above?</p> <p>Then come join us for this open forum where you get to ask what Dan believes are the hot programming languages companies ill be hiring for up to five years from now based on what they know works from years of helping programmers skip the resume and get straight to the job and getting paid!</p> <p><br/>LIMITED 20 person SEATING!

Typically, the tech client is responsible for paying eStaff LLC so unlike other staffing agencies they do not then take from the new hire's  salary! This  is perfect for companies looking to fill a long-term position immediately and thus skip the resume process.</p> <p>• Contract to Hire - This program is for the employers who want to test out candidates before hiring them. This lets them try out a potential candidate for a period of time to see if they fit well with their company and the programmer / developer.</p> <p>• Contract Basis - This allows Estaff to help people like you get a personnel job for a specific period of time. This is particularly helpful for short-term projects or initiatives where a certain expertise is needed. Maybe you just need some extra help getting student debt caught up part time while building up your expertise for the next big career change? ;)</p> <p>• Payrolling - Helps companies take on potential hire that could use some experience before being brought on staff, aka entry level! This option is a low risk, high reward type of scenario.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Come join us for this open forum where you get to ask what Dan believes are the hot programming languages companies ill be hiring for up to five years from now based on what they know works from years of helping programmers skip the resume and get straight to the job and getting paid!</p> <p>LIMITED 25 person SEATING!

Very soon, Austin police officers will be equipped with video cameras (body cams) that will always be on during encounters with the public. But the city has yet to finalize a policy around data collection, data privacy, data retention/expunction and public access. There is a strong interest in public access, especially for video related to misconduct or incidents in which a civilian is hurt or killed. There is also a strong interest in privacy for everyone who may be the subject of body camera video. This talk will walk through some of the options that are on the table for an APD body camera policy that encourages accountability while also protecting privacy.

Recently they have partnered with the U.T. Center for Transportation Research (CTR) in order to utilize this data to inform decision making and guide planning. An important goal for this joint effort is to make as much of this data publicly available as possible and to promote involvement of the community. </p> <p>This talk will cover:</p> <p> * Which digital sensors are currently deployed </p> <p>* What kind of data are being collected </p> <p>* Examples of how sensor data has been used recently by ATD </p> <p>* Plans for utilizing and publishing data in the near future </p> <p>We are also interested in hearing from the civic hacking community. What kinds of data would you like to have access to? What kinds of civic hacking projects could be done in the transportation domain and how could we help support those efforts?

,,,,"<p><i>Note:  Food is prohibited from the City Hall Chambers. Please plan your lunch before or after the event.</i></p> <p><b>Topic:</b></p> <p>Federal and state policymakers are choosing to transform government information into open data. Reforms like the DATA Act and the proposed Financial Transparency Act are pushing data standards across hidebound federal verticals like spending and financial regulation. But the most valuable government information is still stuck in disconnected documents and incompatible databases. Here's how the Data Coalition is fighting for change and what to expect in an open data future.</p> <p><img src=""https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/1/f/f/600_456513279.jpeg"" /></p> <p>


<b>Bio:</b></p> <p>Hudson Hollister founded the Data Coalition in 2012 to serve as the leading industry advocacy group for open data in government. He has helped to craft landmark U.S. government data reforms, including the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) and the Financial Transparency Act. He received the FCW Federal 100 award in 2015 and was recognized as a member of the Fastcase 50 and the LinkedIn Next Wave in 2016.</p> <p>Prior to founding the Data Coalition, Hudson served as counsel to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives and as an attorney fellow in the Office of Interactive Disclosure at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Before his government service, he was a securities litigator in the Chicago office of Latham &amp; Watkins LLP.</p> <p>Hudson received his Juris Doctor from Northwestern University School of Law in 2005 and a bachelor’s degree in political science and mass communication from the University of St. Francis in 2002. He is a native of Joliet, Illinois.</p> <p><b>Summary: </b><br/>The Data Coalition advocates on behalf of the private sector and the public interest for the publication of government information as standardized, open data. Open data enhances accountability, improves government management, reduces compliance costs, and stimulates innovation. Representing a cross-section of the technology industry and implementers, the Coalition’s membership includes market leaders such as Workiva, Donnelley Financial Solutions, Booz Allen Hamilton, and CGI Federal and growing start-ups such as idaciti and CBeyonData.
