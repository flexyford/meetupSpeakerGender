We will have organizers on site who can help facilitate your experience. Also it's rather low key and easy to master!</p> <p><br/>Officially ""Lean Coffee is a structured, but agenda-less meeting. Participants gather, build an agenda, and begin talking. Conversations are directed and productive because the agenda for the meeting was democratically generated.""</p> <p><br/>Unofficially its a group of people interested in asking questions or talking about a user-submitted topic. Attendees nominate topics or pose questions onto Post-It Notes. Attendees then pitch their topic or question to the group in a sentence or two to provide context</p> <p><br/>Members of the group cast three votes each on topics -- they can cast all three votes on one topic or spread them among topics they're interested in</p> <p><br/>Using a timer set for 5 minutes, the group talks about the topic. Once the timer is up, the group votes using thumbs up or down to determine whether to keep discussing. </p> <p><br/>If the up votes have it, the topic continues for another 2 minutes. If the down votes have it, the topic moves to the next swim lane.</p> <p><br/>This is a great tool to allow for community-curated topics to gain attention while staying interesting thanks to the group-driven voting and time boxing! It's been used effectively by some other Meetups with great success. Some teams have even brought the format back to their offices to better facilitate team meetings and agile rituals.</p> <p><b>Our Sept session is brought to you by Dell Technologies and RackSpace.</b></p> <p><br/><b>Reminders:</b></p> <p>• <i><b>LOCATION</b></i> - <b>Rackspace Austin - 9001 North IH35 (east side frontage road) #150, Austin, TX 78753 </b></p> <p>• NOTE: Rackspace security requires you provide a government issued ID in order to gain access to the facility. we recommend you arrive ~ 6:00 - 6:15pm.</p> <p>• There will be a <b>light dinner and soft drinks provided courtesy of Dell Technologies @</b>6:15pm - with networking time till about 6:45pm -<b> we will kick off the speaking sessions ~ 6:45pm.</b></p>",OpenStack Austin Texas,OpenStack and Lean Coffee!!,1473981300000

And sometimes its just someone looking to start a conversation...</p> <p>As someone who is diving back into the indie scene, I thought I would share my early reasoning for jumping into Unity and share some of the advantages Unity offers small dev teams that are just getting started. One of the best things about Unity is that you don't have to be a seasoned game developer in order to jump right in.</p> <p>Unity is a tool through which you are able to add interactivity to almost any form of digital content.

As software developers, we go to great lengths to ensure that users can have a seamless experience. However, allowing users to conveniently access their application allows attackers the opportunity to attack users with just as much ease. The eternal struggle that designers and developers face is striking a balance in design and security in order to not compromise the user but optimize his/her satisfaction. This talk will explore some practical strategies that can be implemented in order to improve the security posture of most applications without compromising on the user experience.</p> <p>

 <b>Speaker bio:</b> David Vo is a senior consultant with nVisium’s Application Consulting practice. His specialties include application pen-test, source code reviews, and vulnerability analysis, including using fuzzing to find software vulnerabilities.

1,0,1,0,"<p>This month's WordPress Practitioner's Meetup is the first in a series of ""The Business of WordPress"" topics our member's have requested. Our WP Practitioners attendees are about evenly divided between business owners and mangers who use WordPress daily in their businesses, and WordPress Freelancers, Developers and Implementors who are building and maintaining WordPress sites for businesses. When I read your topic requests, I approached small business specialist, Sarah Flaherty about presenting to our group. </p> <p>Sarah's tag line is, “Let me think outside the box for you,” illustrates her love for helping emerging businesses and her creativity. In today’s world, there is no unique business, there is only uniqueness. Finding your unique voice is the first and foremost need of a successful business or Freelancer. </p> <p>Your firm’s voice is the single­most important business fundamental, and it is often ignored in our WordPress Community of Developers and Designers. Consumers no longer shop locally, they shop globally ­ on their terms. This makes competition to get their attention, and keep it, fierce. You must be in constant communication with your clients in order to maintain sales and growth. However, you can’t achieve this through a great logo and a fabulous website. You must engage directly with your clients, and this requires you to have a curated voice; consumers flock to you and become your loyal evangelists when they hear and experience your care of them consistently ­ when they know your firm's personality, what and why it's passionate about, and what they can always count on. </p> <p><br/>Sarah C. Flaherty of LUV, LLC will briefly discuss the need to find your voice, how to shape it, and what to do with it once you’ve found it ­ with a focus on social media. This presentation will be followed by a group project that allows you to take a company from conception to initial client communication and will show you the importance of aligning your company’s mission statement with your visuals and content. This will help you better understand your need to content curate to find your firm's unique voice and how to use it going forward.</p> <p>With Sarah’s help, you’ll find that not only will you better understand the hows and whys of what you want to do, but you’ll be better able to focus potential clients’ attention on your business, and keep it.</p> <p><br/>We look forward to seeing you there.

Very soon, Austin police officers will be equipped with video cameras (body cams) that will always be on during encounters with the public. But the city has yet to finalize a policy around data collection, data privacy, data retention/expunction and public access. There is a strong interest in public access, especially for video related to misconduct or incidents in which a civilian is hurt or killed. There is also a strong interest in privacy for everyone who may be the subject of body camera video. This talk will walk through some of the options that are on the table for an APD body camera policy that encourages accountability while also protecting privacy. We will also discuss the process by which such a policy could be enacted, and what will happen if we enact no policy at all.</p> <p><b>Resources:</b></p> <p>• Legislation authorizing body cams and setting the legal framework for Texas: <a href=""http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/84R/billtext/html/SB00158F.htm"">84(R) SB 158 - Enrolled version - Bill Text</a></p> <p>• <a href=""http://www.austintexas.gov/APDbodycam"">City of Austin APD Bodycam page</a></p> <p>• City of Austin body cam vendor <a href=""https://www.austintexas.gov/financeonline/vendor_connection/solicitation/solicitation_details.cfm?sid=110270"">RFP</a>.</p> <p>• <a href=""http://austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Police/APD_Policy_2015-2_Issued_5-1-2015-updated.pdf"">Current body cam policy</a> to be replaced by one that addresses key issues: (Go to policy 303 at page 125.)</p> <p>• <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/02/05/a-new-report-shows-the-limits-of-police-body-cameras/""><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/02/05/a-new-report-shows-the-limits-of-police-body-cameras/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/02/05/a-new-report-shows-the-limits-of-police-body-cameras/</a></a></p> <p>• <a href=""https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/police-body-camera-policies-privacy-and-first-amendment-protections""><a href=""https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/police-body-camera-policies-privacy-and-first-amendment-protections"" class=""linkified"">https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/police-body-camera-policies-privacy-and-first-amendment-protections</a></a></p> <p>--------------------</p> <p>Open Austin hosts a monthly meet-up, to discuss local open government and civic technology issues.

Please plan your lunch before or after the event.</i></p> <p><b>Topic:</b></p> <p>Federal and state policymakers are choosing to transform government information into open data. Reforms like the DATA Act and the proposed Financial Transparency Act are pushing data standards across hidebound federal verticals like spending and financial regulation. But the most valuable government information is still stuck in disconnected documents and incompatible databases. Here's how the Data Coalition is fighting for change and what to expect in an open data future.</p> <p><img src=""https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/1/f/f/600_456513279.jpeg"" /></p> <p>


 <b>Bio:</b></p> <p>Hudson Hollister founded the Data Coalition in 2012 to serve as the leading industry advocacy group for open data in government. He has helped to craft landmark U.S. government data reforms, including the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) and the Financial Transparency Act. He received the FCW Federal 100 award in 2015 and was recognized as a member of the Fastcase 50 and the LinkedIn Next Wave in 2016.</p> <p>Prior to founding the Data Coalition, Hudson served as counsel to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives and as an attorney fellow in the Office of Interactive Disclosure at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Before his government service, he was a securities litigator in the Chicago office of Latham &amp; Watkins LLP.</p> <p>Hudson received his Juris Doctor from Northwestern University School of Law in 2005 and a bachelor’s degree in political science and mass communication from the University of St. Francis in 2002. He is a native of Joliet, Illinois.</p> <p><b>Summary: </b><br/>The Data Coalition advocates on behalf of the private sector and the public interest for the publication of government information as standardized, open data. Open data enhances accountability, improves government management, reduces compliance costs, and stimulates innovation. Representing a cross-section of the technology industry and implementers, the Coalition’s membership includes market leaders such as Workiva, Donnelley Financial Solutions, Booz Allen Hamilton, and CGI Federal and growing start-ups such as idaciti and CBeyonData.

The WPATX community of developers and practitioners are getting excited about all the new possibilities of the WordPress REST API. It has been a while since we have hosted a WPATX Dev Day, and we thought a day devoted to discussion about faster, easier WordPress development using the REST API would be appreciated. </p> <p><br/>This event is designed for our WordPress Developer and Practitioner Community who want to learn how to use the WordPress REST API and explore some applications that are already using it.</p> <p><b>WP Austin REST Day</b> <br/><b>June 17, 2016 <br/></b><b>9 am to 4 pm<br/>WP Engine 10th Floor Classroom</b> </p> <p>The WP Engine classroom will open at 8:30 am and our WP Engine sponsors will be providing Breakfast Tacos and Coffee to help fuel you through the morning sessions, and lunch to power you through an afternoon of learning and doing.</p> <p>The full WP Austin REST Day schedule has not been finalized, but we have posted the highlights and what you can expect from the day.</p> <p>The day will open with a series of presentations by experienced WordPress Developers, who will discuss how the WordPress REST API will give our design and development community more flexibility when building sites, plugins, and themes. Our presenters will address new ways to interact with WordPress posts, users, comments, and taxonomies using the RESTful API standard, which will allow you to create, read, update, and delete the main WordPress objects and provides infrastructure for creating your own custom APIs. They will also discuss how the WordPress REST API can give us the opportunity to integrate with technologies currently outside the WordPress ecosystem.</p> <p>As part of our WP Austin REST Day, we are putting together a WordPress REST API Resources Guide for our WPATX Developers and Practitioners. </p> <p>The morning session will open with several 20-minute presentations. </p> <p><b>Ryan Hoover will lead of the morning sessions off with:</b></p> <p><b>Getting started with the REST API</b></p> <p>• Get it installed on your site</p> <p>• Access posts, comments, other information</p> <p>• Incorporate it into your own site</p> <p><b>Making your own REST API endpoint</b></p> <p>• Give a walk through of the endpoint code structure</p> <p>• Write an endpoint for getting a menu from the WP site</p> <p>• Demonstration of a feature Ryan Hoover wrote for WP Engine to fetch menu items from a WordPress site</p> <p><b>Non-JSON uses of the REST API</b></p> <p>• A demonstration of a REST API feature WP Engine uses to serve up post thumbnail images based on dynamic URLs</p> <p><b>Ryan Oeltjenbruns will follow with:</b></p> <p><b> The traditional view of a web request (front end &amp; back end)</b></p> <p>• Quick understanding of the traditional web request workflow</p> <p>• What does the back end do?</p> <p>• What does the front end do?</p> <p><b>The API approach</b></p> <p>• Quick understanding of a more API focused web request workflow</p> <p>• More generic html source + templates -- shifting some of the work to the front-end</p> <p>• More Javascript heavy front ends that know how to interact with the API</p> <p><b>How this shift directs the focus to the front end, and what this means for WordPress</b></p> <p>• WordPress as a data store?

We will break out into teams of 3-5 people to build their own desired tool using the REST API in some way. Our WPATX team members will have the guidance of floater ""REST API experts"" if they need them to help with implementation.</p> <p>If a team chooses to start a project that will require more time to complete, we can have an async followup where teams can keep working together and share their results at the Advance WordPress Developer's Meetup in August.</p> <p><b>Possible projects for the WPATX REST API Team build:</b></p> <p>• REST API feed for <a href=""http://wpaustin.com/"">wpaustin.com</a> pulling updates into a widget that people can install on their own site</p> <p>• Collaborative blogging platform where the WP Austin community can cross-blog each other easily. (If I have a blog and you have a blog, create an easy, automated means to share posts between our blogs)</p> <p>• Feed of WordCamps and other conferences that members would be interested in (this may get more into RSS aggregation instead of the REST API?)</p> <p>• OR any Mad Science REST API project you have been thinking about</p> <p><br/>WP Engine is contributing the full cost of the WP Austin REST Day as their way to helping the WPATX Community of Developers and Practitioners expand their knowledge base and skills. I know all our members join us in thanking WP Engine for '<i>Gifting' </i>the WPATX Developer community with the opportunity to both learn about and be inspired by the upcoming challenges presented by the REST API. </p> <p>As a WPATX member, your investment is parking, a day away from your business, and spending time with your peers in a great environment to learn something new. If you have not yet considered how the adoption of the REST API will effect your WordPress business, we encourage you to attend and learn from developers who are working with it everyday. </p> <p>If you have been using the WordPress REST API and would like to present or demo your WP REST API project, please contact Sandi Batik using Meetup messaging. </p> <p>One of the best comments I've read about the WordPress REST API is from a our good friend, Josh Pollack -</p> <p><i>“Our community is hearing that the WP REST API is going to change WordPress and they haven’t seen that happen. I don’t see the WP REST API as changing WordPress.
